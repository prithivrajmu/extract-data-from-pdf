### Supported Versions

### Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of this project seriously. If you discover a vulnerability:

1. **Do not** open a public issue.
2. Email the maintainer directly at **security@prithiv.dev** with the following:
   - Detailed description of the issue and potential impact
   - Steps to reproduce (proof-of-concept preferred)
   - Suggested fix or mitigation (if available)
3. You will receive an acknowledgement within **48 hours**.

We aim to provide an initial assessment within **5 business days** and, when
possible, will publish a fix within **14 business days**. You will be credited in
the changelog unless you request anonymity.

### Disclosure Process

1. Receive and validate the report.
2. Prepare and test a fix in a private branch.
3. Coordinate a release with the reporter.
4. Publish a security advisory and update the changelog.
